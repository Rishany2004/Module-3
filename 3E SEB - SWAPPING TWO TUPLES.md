## SEB - SWAPPING TWO TUPLES

### AIM  
To write a Python program to accept two tuples from the user and swap their values.

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.
2. Accept two tuples from the user using eval() and store them in tuple1 and tuple2.
3. Swap the tuples using tuple unpacking: tuple1, tuple2 = tuple2, tuple1.
4. Print the values of tuple1 and tuple2 after the swap.
5. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM
```
tuple1=eval(input())
tuple2=eval(input())
tuple1,tuple2=tuple2,tuple1
print(tuple1)
print(tuple2)
```

### RESULT
Thus the Python program to swap the values of two tuples was executed successfully and verified.
